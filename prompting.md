# Prompting

- Just brainstorming some considerations and possibilities
- The only way to know what works is by testing it out
- Likely need some context for the repo and project

Almost certainly have to nudge it towards writing good commits, rather than replicating what it's seen before
`Use industry best practices`

Slight chance naming a few very popular repos will help
`Write in the style used in the linux kernel`

Probably need at least one example

Can try telling it what NOT to do
