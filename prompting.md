# Prompting

Likely need some context for the repo and project

Almost certainly have to nudge it towards writing good commits, rather than replicating what it's seen before
> Use industry best practices
> Write like a senior developer who takes pride in their commit messages
> Explain "why" certain changes were made

Slight chance naming a few very popular repos will help
> Write in the style used in the linux kernel

## Context

Entire file structure is fairly cheap so probably just include that

Would be nice to have custom examples for whatever the current repo does

## Experimentation

The end of the message seems to always be part of the commit message

It'll sometimes use conventional commits, making it always do that would make parsing easier
