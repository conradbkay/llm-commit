# LLM Commit

Hopefully use any model to generate above average commit messages. The bar has never been lower

Most of the refinement will likely come in the form of better prompting, or just better models being released

## Setup

### .env

```ini
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
```

## Roadmap

- Turn into a CLI tool
- More APIs (Deepseek, openAI, xAI)
- Run on previous commits
- Run on commits in date range, manually approve/deny all changes or ask it to try again
- Might as well have a frontend for the above
